        to conduct the ENQ Token Sale on Ethereum using an Ethereum-based smart contract. It is proposed that ENQ(ERC20)
        will initially be issued as part of the ENQ Token Sale.</p>
        <p>The allocation of the ENQ(ERC20) is proposed to be as follows:</p>
        <p>a) 596,756,160 ENQ(ERC20) are proposed to be available for sale under the ENQ Token Sale, which will be
          subject to the ENQ Token Sale terms and conditions.. The price for the sale is proposed to be 1 ENQ(ERC20) =
          0.04 USD. It is intended that it will be possible to exchange ENQ(ERC20) for ENQ at a rate of 1:1, once the
          Enecuum adaptive decentralized environment is operational;</p>
        <p>b) 64,864,800 ENQ(ERC20) are proposed to be reserved for advisers and partners. It is intended that it will
          be possible to exchange ENQ(ERC20) for ENQ at a rate of 1:1, once the Enecuum adaptive decentralized
          environment is operational;</p>
        <p class="mb0">c) 25,945,920 ENQ(ERC20) are proposed to be reserved as a wallet installation reward. It is intended that it
          will be possible to exchange ENQ(ERC20) for ENQ at a rate of 1:1, once the Enecuum adaptive decentralized
          environment is operational.</p>
