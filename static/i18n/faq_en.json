              "title": "What is ENQ (Enecuum)?",
              "text": "ENQ is a new generation blockchain that combines advantages of its predecessors. It started as a vision of a better system and grew into the concept of an adaptive decentralized environment where any business goal can be reached. The idea emerged in 2015 and shaped up into a complete design around 2017-2018. Now we’re working to give users the performance they always wanted. We aim to offer better smart contracts, zero fee transactions for active users, private branches and many other amazing features. All that with unprecedented interoperability."
            },
            {
              "title": "Why have we started ENQ?",
              "text": "The vast majority of blockchain projects are based on a single technical concept. Different concepts and protocols keep them apart from each other and have different properties: some are quick, other are secure. We don’t want to be bound by their limitations, we want to implement all the best practices. ENQ’s architecture was built from scratch to be flexible, to include any blockchain native application that had already been created in the ecosystem and develop new technologies in parallel. Using hybrid consensus algorithm and HyperDAG ENQ provides interoperability of high speed, high security and scalability."
            },
            {
              "title": "How does hybrid consensus algorithm work?",
              "text": "Hybrid consensus algorithm allows a wide range of devices for mining. It envisions three stages. First stage is PoW mining on dedicated machines using a Cryptonight-like algorithm to find a hash of certain complexity and open a macroblock. Second stage is PoA mining on mobile devices to create microblocks with transactions in them and publish them into the macroblock. Third stage is PoS mining to recheck the changed state of accounts associated with the transactions. All that in multiple threads, in parallel."
            },
            {
              "title": "What is HyperDAG?",
              "text": "HyperDAG stands for Hyper Directed Acyclic Graph. Its major difference from an ordinary DAG is that a new transaction added to the system can have an edge with not just one, but a whole group of previously added transactions that were published in a microblock. As a result, HyperDAG successfully combines advantages of both traditional blockchain and DAG paradigms, at the same time remedying their shortcomings. HyperDAG is designed to be able to process millions of transactions per second and be well-secured against attacks."
            },
            {
              "title": "Is ENQ truly decentralized?",
              "text": "The highest possible degree of decentralization is our aim and one of our main differentiation factors. We seek to make mobile users equal participants of our decentralized environment, which in turn makes it scale faster, use less resources and be decentralized in the true sense of this word."
            },
            {
              "title": "What are the ENQ advantages?",
              "text": "Higher speed - ENQ looks like a racing car among blockchain projects. Brand new HyperDAG-based architecture is capable of millions transaction per second.\nBetter scalability - a possibility to increase size of blocks dynamically, adapting to any network size; multilevel sharding paradigm; the SHARNELL linear logic for building fault-resistant smart contracts.\nStronger security - private sidechains and a unique hybrid consensus algorithm designed to guarantee true decentralization.\n"

              "text": "- Decentralized data storage\n- Tokens, Tickets and private sidechains\n- Marks for targeted fund allocation and expenses\n- Ready-to-use platform for ICO’s + a cancellation model aimed to facilitate conducting complex crowdsales with multiple sale rounds and refunds to the members of the whitelist at any stage\n- Possibility to run heavy smart contracts on nodes with high computational power and perform complex calculations \n- API for fast integration with existing business processes\n"
            },
            {
              "title": "Does ENQ have a cryptocurrency?",
              "text": "The ENQ token (“ENQ”, consistent with the company name) is the native token of the environment and is also the main medium of exchange for the Tickets, Tokens and other cryptocurrencies in it. ENQ’s are proposed to be generated according to system specific parameters and paid out to miners as a reward for spending their computational power. ENQ’s can be received and sent with no fees. They can also be used as payment for publishing smart contracts to the network, performing complex mathematical computations via a smart contract, creating custom macroblocks, new Tokens and private branches, and participation in PoS mining."
